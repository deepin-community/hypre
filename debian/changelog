hypre (2.21.0-1exp1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * New upstream release.
    - src/config/boostrap was renamed to update.sh
      Update debian patch configure.patch to mark it as #!/bin/bash
  * provide 64-bit builds
    - --with-bigint provided in packages libhypre64-dev and libhypre64
      (HYPRE_BigInt and HYPRE_Int both 64 bit)
    - --with-mixedint provided in libhypre64m-dev and libhypre64m
      (64-bit HYPRE_BigInt with 32-bit HYPRE_Int)
      But libhypre64m (mixedint) might not be safe. Segfaults have been
      reported in MPI tests. libhypre64m should be considered
      experimental. See https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre/issues/326
    - debian patch library_name_extension.patch adds
      --with-libname-ext configure option and HYPRE_LIBNAME_EXT
      Makefile variable to add extension to library name, to generate
      libHYPRE64.so or libHYPRE64m.so
    - document 64-bit builds in README.Debian. mixedint libhypre64m
      might give better performance than bigint libhypre64 on cloud
      computing infrastructure with memory bandwidth constraints.
  * drop FEI support (libHYPRE_FEI.so).
    FEI is an external library released by Sandia NL (but no longer
    developed) which needs to be available at build time (defining
    fei_defs.h et al.) in order for HYPRE to support it. FEI source is
    available with Trilinos source, but has not been packaged for
    Debian. FEI source was previously provided with HYPRE (in
    src/FEI_mv/fei-base), but was removed in hypre 2.17.0.
  * provide single library libHYPRE.so.
    i.e. don't split out libHYPRE_core.so, since libHYPRE_FEI.so is
    now dropped
    - drop debian patches install.patch and
      shlibs-interlink-libHYPRE.so.patch
  * report test timings
    - skip TEST_bench at build time (takes a long time to complete)
  * update debian patch test.patch to make awk script in runcheck.sh
    validate that data is being read ((getline < ofilename) > 0).
    Otherwise a memory-leaking infinite loop is formed if output files
    do not exist (e.g. test could not be run), since getline returns -1
    if the file is missing.
  * skip selected tests at build time and in debian/tests (autopkgtest)
    - TEST_bench, takes an unacceptably long time to run (more than
      all other tests combined). Skip at build-time, run in autopkgtest.
    - TEST_examples, TEST_fei, executables are not available
    - TEST_timing, the unusual shell arithmetic in efficiency.sh is
      not supported
    - build-tests are NOT run for the libhypre64m (mixedint) build, due
      to segfaults in MPI tests. libhypre64m might not be safe,
      see above (and https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre/issues/326 )

    delayed in the NEW queue. See README.Debian.

hypre (1.6.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild with new mpich and linked against libblas-3.so.
  * Fixed configure to actually use -with-blas= value.
  * Fixed build-depends, replacing obsolete mpich with libmpich1.0-dev and
    adding version 3 BLAS dev.
  * Appended c2 to shared lib package name since it includes C++ objects.
  * Massive changes to link shared libs with all of their dependent libs.
  * Removed HYPRE_BuildIJMatrixFromDistributedMatrix() because it uses an
    obsolete IJ_mv API.
  * Got rid of a bunch of @s in Makefiles to make build more transparent.
  * Added libHYPRE_Euclid to SSTRUCT_LFLAGS in test/Makefile.in so it works.
  * Added Makefile removal to clean target to avoid bloated .diff.gz.
  * Added installation of lintian overrides files.
