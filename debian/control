Description: High Performance Matrix Preconditioners - 64-bit (mixedint) Development Files
 Hypre is a set of matrix preconditioning libraries to aid in the
 solution of large systems of linear equations.
 .
 This package contains the headers and symlinks necessary to develop
 programs which use hypre with 64-bit HYPRE_BigInt and 32-bit HYPRE_Int
 (--with-mixedint).
 .
 Note that segfaults have been reported in MPI tests. libhypre64m
 (mixedint) might not be safe, and should be considered experimental.
